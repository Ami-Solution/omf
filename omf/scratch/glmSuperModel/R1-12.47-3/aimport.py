''' Make a GLD superModel. 

TODO
XXX Which prototypical feeder? Smallest (R1-12.47-3_NR). Maybe try R4-25.00-1 later.
XXX Which solution method? Need NR.
XXX Edit the tiny feeder to remove colon-number naming.
XXX What all technologies? List below.
XXX How to get 'em on there? Get one prosumer working (ish).
XXX File attachments? Added.
XXX Run omf.models.gridlabMulti.
XXX Any way to disembed that market player? Yes, by name. Added to prosumer.
XXX Other things to add? Wind. IVVC. 
XXX Base case feeder.
XXX Pin everything in the feeder editor.
XXX Save a nice omf.model.gridlabMulti demo.
XXX Take a look at "R4-25.00-1".
XXX Descriptions of the actual prototype feeders.
OOO Bonus points? Single phase wind. Get a realistic IVVC.

TINY FEEDER DESCRIPTION
This feeder is a representation of a moderately populated urban area. This is composed mainly of mid-sized commercial loads with some residences, mostly multi-family. Approximately 85% of the circuit-feet are overhead and 15% underground. It would be expected that this feeder is connected to adjacent feeders through normally open switches. For this reason it would be common to limit the feeder loading to 60% to ensure the ability to transfer load from other feeders, and vice versa. Since this is a small urban core the loading of the feeder is well below 60%. The majority of the load is located relatively near the substation.

TECHNOLOGIES
Per-house:
* Storage.
* Solar.
* Diesel (on a very few).
* Wind (on a very few).
* EVs.
Other stuff:
* Market auction (RTP?).
* CPP.
* IVVC.
